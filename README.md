# SimpleIP
A simple, privacy-respecting web tool that displays the user's IP address.

# How it works
On load, the user's browser sends a request to [ipify](https://www.ipify.org/), an [open-source](https://github.com/rdegges/ipify-api) and limit-free API that stores no user information.
Then, the code loads the IP address, and applies CSS styles and gradients to it. I added code to automatically change backgrounds and text borders based on detected dark/light preferences.
The Poppins font is from [fonts.upset.dev](https://upset.dev/fonts), not Google Fonts.

# How to use it
